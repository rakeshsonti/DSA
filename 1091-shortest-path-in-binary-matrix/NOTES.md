Time Complexity: The time complexity of this code is O(N * M), where N is the number of rows in the grid and M is the number of columns. This is because the code iterates over each cell in the grid at most once.
​
Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(N * M) as well. The space is used to store the dist matrix, which has dimensions N * M, and the queue q, which can store at most N * M elements in the worst case.
​
Overall, your solution has a time and space complexity of O(N * M).
