## Collection data strucure till Java 8

> In Java 8, the following collection data structures are available:

* **ArrayList**: An implementation of the List interface that uses an array to store the elements.

* **LinkedList**: An implementation of the List interface that uses a doubly-linked list to store the elements.

* **HashSet**: An implementation of the Set interface that uses a hash table to store the elements.

* **TreeSet**: An implementation of the SortedSet interface that uses a red-black tree to store the elements.

* **HashMap**: An implementation of the Map interface that uses a hash table to store key-value pairs.

* **TreeMap**: An implementation of the SortedMap interface that uses a red-black tree to store key-value pairs.

* **LinkedHashMap**: An implementation of the Map interface that maintains a doubly-linked list of the entries in the map, in the order they were inserted.

* **ArrayDeque**: An implementation of the Deque interface that uses an array to store the elements.

* **PriorityQueue**: An implementation of the Queue interface that stores elements in a priority queue.

* **Stack**: A class that implements the Stack data structure using an array.
