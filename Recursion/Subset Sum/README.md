## Time Complexity: 
      O(2^n)+O(2^n log(2^n)). Each index has two ways. You can either pick it up or not pick it. 
      So for n index time complexity for O(2^n) and for sorting it will take (2^n log(2^n)).

## Space Complexity: 
    O(2^n) for storing subset sums, since 2^n subsets can be generated for an array of size n.
