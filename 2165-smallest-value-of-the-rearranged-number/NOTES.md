#### Time complexity and space complexity
* nlog(n)+O(n)+O(1)
* O(n) string
​
#### Approach
* if no is negative then sort in descending order and return as negative
* if positive then convert to string
* sort in ascending order
* find first non zero character and erase that character from the string and add to front of the string
